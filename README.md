![build](https://travis-ci.org/sbelkin/kingsforge.svg?branch=master)

Another attempt to code a game.

Most of the game is based on rolling dice of 6 type.
Getting Gathering Cards/Dock Generics. To generate more dice of different types.
Then use those dice to roll to get Craft Cards.
 
Added basic entities. Basic parsing of csv.
